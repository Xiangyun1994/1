# A snapshot near-infrared hyperspectral demosaicing method with convolutional neural networks in low illumination environment
A snapshot hyperspectral demosaicing method is proposed to reconstruct raw mosaic images into full-resolution hyperspectral images. We experimentally validate the merits of the method by 5 Ã— 5 raw mosaic images.
